    Convert HDF5 filter and compression instructions into instructions understood
    by numcodecs. Input is a pyfive filter_pipeline object, the itemsize, and the
    dataset name for error messages.

    We can only support things that are supported by our storage backends, which
    is a rather limited range right now:
     - gzip compression, and
     - shuffle filter 

    See aslso zarr kerchunk _decode_filters. We may need to add much more 
    support for BLOSC than currently supported.

    Useful notes on filters are here:
     - https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-c/current/filters.html and
     - https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/v1_8/group___h5_z.html

    In particular, note that we can only support things that go beyond native HDF5
    if _we_ support them directly.
